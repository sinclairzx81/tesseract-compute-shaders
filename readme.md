# tesseract-compute-shaders

gpgpu compute shaders using tesseract. [demo](https://sinclairzx81.github.io/tesseract-compute-shaders/)

### overview

This project is a shader toy backing infrastructure using the tesseract gpgpu library (webgl 2.0). The basis of this project is test tesseract against shader toy fragment shaders, and to provide a scriptable host for running and experimenting with shader toy programs in general.

This project is a work in progress.
